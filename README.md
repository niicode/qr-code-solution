## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Responsive design

### What I learned

I learnt how to use the html semantic markup to create a responsive QR code component. This is to help accessibility and make the QR code more accessible to users. And also the bem methodology in naming my classes.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<main>
  <section></section>
  <section></section>
</main>
```
```css
.bem-style__element {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

### Useful resources

- [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org) - This helped me understand html semantic tags. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
